    "#### Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?\n",
    "**Ans:** **`__iter__`** and **`__next__`** are the operator overloading methods in python that support iteration and are collectively called iterator protocol.The Python interpreter will automatically call the `__iter__()` method when an instance of your class is used in a for loop. The Python interpreter will then call the `__next__()` method repeatedly until it raises a StopIteration exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`__iter__`** returns the iterator object and is called at the start of loop in our respective class.\n",
    "- **`__next__`** is called at each loop increment, it returns the incremented value. Also Stopiteration is raised when there is no value to return.\n",

    "#### Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?\n",
    "**Ans:** **`__str__`** and **`__repr__`** are two operator overloading methods that manage printing.\n",
    "- In Short, the difference between both these operators is the goal of **`__repr__`** is to be unambiguous and **`__str__`** is to be readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whenever we are printing any object reference internally **`__str__`** method will be called by default.\n",
    "- The main purpose of **`__str__`** is for readability. it prints the informal string representation of an object, one that is useful for printing the object. it may not be possible to convert result string to original object.\n",
    "- **`__repr__`** is used to print official string representation of an object, so it includes all information and development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, __str__() is used more often than __repr__(), since it provides a more user-friendly and readable representation of an object. __repr__() is typically used in situations where a more detailed or technical representation of an object is required, such as in debugging or serialization scenarios."

    "\n",
    "In Python, you can capture in-place addition by overriding the `__iadd__(self, other)` method in your class definition. The` __iadd__()` method implements in-place addition by calculating the sum of two objects and assigning the result to the first operand. The method returns the new value to be assigned to the first operand. \n"
