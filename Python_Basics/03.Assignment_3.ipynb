    "2. Increases program readability.\n",

    "**Ans:**The code in a function executes when the function is called, not when the function is specified. When a function is \"called\" the program \"leaves\" the current section of code and begins to execute the first line inside the function. Example is mentioned below:"

    "**Ans**: The Python return statement is a key component of functions and methods. We can use the return statement to make functions send Python objects back to the caller code. These objects are known as the functionâ€™s return value. A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to. Like any value, a return value can be used as part of an expression. "
